      purpose = <"OxygenSaturationArterialBlood is a measurement model. A measurement model holds a 'question' or a 'test' in the key and holds a numeric value  answer in result. For example, in the HeartRateMeas model, the 'question' or the 'test' is 'What is the heart rate measurement?', and the 'answer' in data can be '100 bpm'. In the 'OxygenSaturationArterialBloodMeas' model the question is 'what is the subject's Oxygen Saturation Arterial Blood Measurement?' and the numeric answer will have a unit of measure. Oxygen Saturation Arterial Blood Measurement by definition means a subject's (arterial) oxygen saturation in a clinical, not laboratory, setting. LOINC code 59408-5    DMM: This model has been built to accept a pulse oximeter reading, and only a pulse oximeter reading  based on the Key, its LOINC mapping, default display, historic use at Intermountain, and the LOINC mapping in the notes of this model.  This model should be renamed OxygenSaturationArterialBloodPulseOximeterMeas and the Key display changed to OxygenSaturationArterialBloodPulseOximeter_KEY_CODE.  The MethodDevice should be constrained to Pulse Oximeter.  We need to create a new model called OxygenSaturationArterialBloodMeas, with a key of OxygenSaturationArterialBlood_KEY_CODE, and that key should go on NCID 6712, which is mapped to LOINC 2708-6.  MethodDevice in that model should be constrained to devices which measure oxygen saturation. ">
